# B-SWARM prototype

## Quick Overview
B-Swarm is a distributed data mining-based approach for intelligence collection and incident response awareness (source code released under a GPLv3 license).
This approach uses multiple positions on the Internet (i.e., vantage points and collector instances) to interact with the specified online resources (e.g., URLs).
The representation of the same information source is collected and evaluated from multiple perspectives to identify significant content changes among them.
