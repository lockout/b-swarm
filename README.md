# B-SWARM prototype

## Quick Overview
B-Swarm is a distributed data mining-based approach for intelligence collection and incident response awareness released under a GPLv3 license.
This approach uses multiple positions (i.e., vantage points and collector instances) on the Internet to interact with the specified online resources (e.g., URLs).
The representation of the same information source is collected and evaluated from multiple perspectives to identify significant content changes.
